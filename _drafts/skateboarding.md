The Thursday before last, I rode a skateboard for the first time.

It had been something I'd been meaning to learn since at least late college. I have a list of these types of things--I know it's only a matter of time before I teach myself to solve a Rubik's Cube--but starting a new job in downtown Durham was the perfect excuse to finally learn. It turns out that there isn't really much of anywhere to skate to in the suburban paradox that is Morrisville. 

The first time I did this, abruptly deciding that there was no reason not to just figure out how to do some thing in particular, was the summer after high school. After (initially tenuously) playing Guitar Hero on my sister's PS2 and getting good enough to finish most of the songs on Expert, I took the loading screen tip about actually picking up a real guitar at some point seriously and placed my order, with the money earned from writing newsletter articles about World of Warcraft. I bought a cheap version of the guitar Angus Young of AC/DC plays, with a crappy amp. I have since sold the amp, but I still have the guitar, and it has its own charm and sound.

The most recent time I decided to acquire a new skill was two years ago, when I decided there was no good reason I didn't know how to ride a motorcycle. Unlike skateboarding, I had never planned at any point to end up on two tires, but I was hanging out with the right group of people and had the right amount of disposable income and was just the right amount of young and invulnerable to do it. Now, I can't imagine doing without it. 

I first stepped on the board that Thursday, armed with knowledge from YouTube and a complete lack of care for anything except learning a new skill. That first day, I spent an hour on the board, first standing on it to get my balance, then slowly rolling down a shallow hill on it. After that first session, I couldn't do anything you could call "riding" a skateboard, but I knew that the body and the brain take time to rewire, sync up, and build the necessary muscles. 

The next day, I went out and practiced again. That day, I got a little better, and was able to control the board down the slope and a little bit up the next side. I started learning to push while on the board, to unreliably do what might be called riding. After that, I kept practicing. Each time, I found my body had learned, literally overnight, to control the board better and balance more effectively than I could have hoped 24 hours ago. 

Then I started riding places. At first, the grocery store a mile away. Then the UPS store two miles away. Each time, growing a little bit more cavalier and adventurous. Taking on a little more speed, a little bigger hills, learning I could do more than I thought. 

I've long thought that the only way to find your limits is to go out and touch them. So many people live in fear of what someone might say or what might happen or what the consequences could be, but that way lies a fearful, timid life. Did I once crash my motorcycle at lunch on a Wednesday and have to go back to work with literal blood on my hands? Yeah. Did I learn from that experience and have yet to crash again since? Also yes.

So last Thursday, a week after first stepping on the board and after probably ten hours spent on the board, going from unable to balance to being able to balance on my one foot and push with the other three or four times in a row, I had my first big wipeout. Took all the skin off one knee, scratched up every hand, leg, and arm except for one (my left elbow). I was going down a hill, trying to conserve my momentum for the oncoming uphill, and hit a pavement imperfection (pothole) and began a harmoic oscillation of overcorrecting my steering until eventually I estimated I couldn't salvage it, jumped off the board, and was going too fast for my feet to catch. I ended up tucking and rolling and coming out scathed but without permanent injury.

In my theoretical analysis of skateboards, I had thought them rather clever devices because they are very good at what human legs are not (conserving momentum on downhill slopes), and can be fairly easily carried up hills, unlike, say, a bicycle. In my analysis, however, I completely omitted the presence of brakes, which turns out to be a significant downside of the board. A huge hill with imperfect pavement, or a cross street in the middle, or just too steep of an incline means you're walking down it, just the same as if it was an uphill.

Of course, I had to go and find out how steep a hill I could handle. Now that I've done that, as I write this, having two large bandaids on my body and copious antiseptic ointment, I've found my boundaries. I went out, touched them, and now I know the parameters to live within, instead of trying to guess them out of fear. 

Long term, that's probably a good situation to be in, but at this moment, I'm really not looking forward to the next shower I have to take with these wounds.

*Post-script: this is not The Big Accident. That would come a few weeks later. I have skated since then, but purely for fun. At this point in my life, the skateboard just doesn't have much of the utility I imagined. What about one with brakes for controlling downhill speed, though...*
