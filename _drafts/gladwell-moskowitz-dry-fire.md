I'm a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's writing. I wasn't always, and before I wasn't, I was a fan of his books, but these days, it's the opposite. I've read _Blink_ and I've read _Outliers_ and now find them overly broad and unconvincing. His normal formula seems to be to find an interesting corner of humanity and tell its story, but when he tries to scale that up to a book-length piece, it just gets watered-down and diffuse.

That said, those small stories, the small lessons about how people work and sometimes don't work, are fascinating. As evidence, I will present two examples and encourage you to read and ruminate on both.

The first is a written piece for the New Yorker, which is where his good, short writings appear. This is his latest, at the time of this writing, and possibly the most interesting thing I've read this year. It's a [fascinating attempt to contextualize the siege at Waco in the 90s](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/03/31/140331fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all). When you realize the very fundamental disconnect between the mindset of the Branch Davidians (people wanting to be left alone in peace) and the feds treating them like hostage-taking terrorists, it's kinda obvious that there could be no peaceful outcome. Just... read it.

The second piece is a [TED talk he did](http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce) back when doing a TED talk actually meant something. This one is on the the concept of what he calls "variability", the idea that there is no perfect single mustard or spaghetti sauce and that different people cluster around preferring different things, and embracing that can lead to huge advances in satisfaction.

Now, since the time of the stories he tells in that talk, the food industry has pretty much adopted that notion wholesale, which is why there are dozens of salad dressings and types of sodas and barbeque sauces ([ketchup being the exception, of course](http://gladwell.com/the-ketchup-conundrum/)). But this particular video is one that I find myself re-watching every year or two because every time, it makes me consider the lesson in a new context.

In this particular case, the new context is my hobby-turned-professional-specialization: mobile application design. Recently, I have been hard at work writing, of all things, an Android application to inform you of the weather. In a marketplace utterly stuffed with apps to do everything from set your ringtone to automate your life, it's tempting to think that everything's been done, which is true in most cases. What's rarer is that it's been done truly well, even once. And beyond that, it seems obvious that, just like there is no perfect Pepsi (only perfect Pepsi*s*), there is likely no perfect weather app. The one that I'm making may not be everyone's ideal app, but it's hopefully going to make a small subset of the Android user base very happy, and if you listen to Howard Moskowitz, that's all you can hope for.

This has also reared its head in my personal Android project, an app that ironically actually managed to find the niche small enough that it hadn't been filled in the existing marketplace: an app for competitive pistol shooters to practice their speed drills. It came along before I had any concept that I was going to write Android for a living, and since starting the job, I've been locked in a kind of analysis paralysis, trying to deduce the single best way to train with an app, and then make the app to do that.

But the realization I'm having almost as I type this is that there likely is no perfect training method that is effective and enjoyable for everyone. I wanted to build one, simple, elegant app that everyone could use and benefit from, but that's just not possible. At best that app could work very well for a fraction of people. So at first I'll build the dry fire timer app that works for me, and then, hopefully, get enough feedback to figure out what works for everyone else. (Another of Moskowitz's teachings, that asking people what they want is useless, does weigh heavy on me, though.)

Finally, the logjam is broken. I'm not setting out write the perfect dry fire timer. I'm setting out to write the perfect dry fire timer**s**.
