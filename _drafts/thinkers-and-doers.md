-Two types of people
-Luke is one, I'm the other
-TT wouldn't be what it is today without both of us
-Didn't let not being a tech guy stop him
-Being at thinker is all well and good but not without downsides
-Uncorrelated with extra/introversion

Growing up, I remember being baffled by people around me and their decisions. Couldn't they see that wasn't going to work, or that doing the same thing over again was going to give the same result? And as I sat and thought this to myself, content with not making those mistakes, they were off trying and failing and every once in a while succeeding. Those people are what I've come to call *doers*, by way of contrast to characterizing myself as a *thinker*. 

I deliberately chose words that were neutral to try and avoid bias, because what I've come to realize is, once I get past my [illusory superiority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority), being a thinker actually has non-trivial drawbacks. In particular, essentially living life in a state of paralyzing analysis of possible outcomes, with a fairly negative weight against long-shot odds. *Oh that'll never work because there's already thousands of guys doing that, so what's one more? The odds of actually succeeding are so low, it's better to take the sure thing.* A thinker knows that the odds of him being able to time the stock market and make it rich are very small and the prudent long-term decision is to just diversify and wait. The doer doesn't care and wants to take the chance because it could work out: and sometimes it does!

The part of my life that has brought this in to starkest relief is one of the more unpredictable and interesting projects I've gotten involved with: a little shooting blog and podcast called Triangle Tactical. The guy who runs it, Luke, is to my mind a classic doer. A few years ago, he decided that he didn't like his job and wanted to be a gun blogger and so he just bought a domain and some hosting and set up a blog. It sucked at first, like everything does, but since then he's iterated and improved it a lot. To this day, even as I've become more involved with the content of the site, I still have never touched the backend server or webpages. Despite my training and experience with websites, Luke gets more done, thanks to two principles, both the topic of future blog posts: motivation gets more done than competence, and it's important to not know what you can't do. He went out and did it,
