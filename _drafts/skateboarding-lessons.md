title:  "Three Things I Learned From Teaching Myself To Skateboard"

I have a list of things I'm going to learn to do eventually, like hunting a deer or solving a Rubik's cube, and with my recent transition to a new job in a new city, I decided it was time to tick one off the list: riding a skateboard.

I had long thought of the skateboard as not just a cool youth's toy, but a strong hybrid of practical design. See, my idea went, human legs are really good at one thing: going up hills and stairs. Even pedaling a bike uphill often feels like a waste of energy compared to just walking the bike up. On the other hand, human legs are enormously wasteful when traveling on flat or downhill ground where we have to throw away our momentum with every step. Running helps, but that is a lot more work. So a tool like a skateboard that was man-portable (unlike a bicycle) and light enough to be carried easily uphill but ridden on flats and downhills seemed like a genius design.

So this Spring, now that I was spending a lot of time in Downtown Durham, and walking to a lot of places (mostly bars), I decided getting around on a board would be the perfect thing to do for the impending summer. So I made a half-joking post on Facebook a few weeks before my birthday party demanding someone buy me a skateboard for my birthday (post-scripted with "I am not joking").

#### Lesson 1: Skateboards are Expensive

I'll be honest, I hadn't really given it much thought. In the hours after making that post, I realized that I was asking for a gift that, to be worthwhile, would cost upwards of $100. Never having been a part of the culture, I had no concept of how much went in to a truly decent skateboard and how precise, for example, the bearings inside the wheels are built or how the trucks attach to the deck to be just loose enough to steer but not loose enough to wobble.

As it happened, I ended up with a board that, all told would sell for about $250, for the desk, wheels, bearings, and trucks. Of course that board came as a bolt out of the blue, indeed as a gift from a friend who mysteriously just had it gathering dust in her closet from someone else.

#### Lesson 2: Skateboards are mostly for flat, wide terrain

My original mental model of a skateboard as being ideal for downslopes of any shape or size could not end up being more wrong for one, obvious in retrospect, reason: no brakes.
