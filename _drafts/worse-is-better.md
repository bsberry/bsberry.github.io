The Unix Beards have a long tradition of "worse is better", the idea that less is more, fewer features are better, and you can probably get by without having everything. The most typical example of this is the entire suite of unix command line tools, each one of which is fairly dumb, but which you can string together in very powerful ways. Rather than creating one monolithic, awesome tool, they created dozens of small, simple ones that are easy to update and interchange.

Obviously, "worse is better" is an oversimplification, because you need some feature to make anything worthwhile, but in life the tendency is very, very rarely for less instead of more, and the mantra is a reminder to live simply and ship early.
