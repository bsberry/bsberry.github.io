By default, I approach most situations with a sense of humility. Any time I lack a preponderance of experience (computer programming and pistol shooting, mostly), I assume I'm nothing special. I assume I'm not any smarter or more capable than other people who've looked at this problem and that the generally accepted solution is probably the right one. 

This is occasionally true, but these days it seems like it's more wrong than it is right. 

Writing a blog requires acknowledging that you know something other people don't, or at least can synthesize something intrinsic in an illuminating way. Hosting a podcast requires acknowledging that you know more than other people and can tell them so. Steve Anderson in his podcast talks about not being the guy with all the answers, but just being the guy a little bit further down the rabbit hole and leading the way by shining his flashlight where to go. I know that this feeling of inadequacy never goes away, because he talks about it and he's a USPSA GM with a successful career writing shooting books and teaching classes. 

And then there are the other facets of life where what seems obvious and unremarkable is inconceivable to someone else.
