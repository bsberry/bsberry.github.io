When I first read *Rocket Boys*, it was an extra credit assignment. I was never an especially hard worker in school, being able to largely skate by with mostly completing homework assignments and retaining the whats, whens, and whys of public schooling. But when there was extra credit, I would jump on it when it was something I was good at, to have that extra cushion to my grades so my parents wouldn't bother me about playing Counter-Strike all the time. So extra credit for stuff like building a diorama or whatever wouldn't catch my attention, but reading a book about science and math and then answering questions about it was basically like getting credit for breathing air.

I don't recall, but I guess my parents bought me a hardcover copy of the book that I still have today and read periodicially. Or maybe I borrowed it from the school or public library at first and the hardcover came later. At any rate, my 8th grade geometry teacher's ploy to get us reading about applied math worked flawlessly, at least on me. By the time I finished the book, I knew I liked it, in a way that I never had with Asimov or Tolkien or Brust. 

See, *Rocket Boys* is the story of a rag-tag group of high school boys in a company coal town in the middle of nowhere West Virginia who get inspired by Sputnik and Werner von Braun to build and launch their own rockets. Growing up where they did, nothing more was expected of them than to finish high school and then go work in the mine, but they decided, without being asked or told by anyone else, to set out on this quest to launch some rockets. 

Reading the book for the first time as an 8th grader, I was impressed by its message of opportunity and ambition, that if these kids not much older than me in a much less advantageous situation could set there minds to something and do it, then I probably could to. When I read it again in 9th grade, it left a similar impression, except now I'd had a taste of the wide open possibilities of high school with its electives and clubs and advanced classes.

That pretty much carried on throughout my time at Southeast Raleigh High, reading the book every year or so and each time find it freshly invigorating.
