Another interesting thing from [Jocko Podcast #13 around the 1h44m mark](https://youtu.be/Xqy3Sh7BlaY?t=6258) is the discussion of being too direct, which hit home for me because the day I'd just had.

I'm on a new project at work, working with a new team, and ended up having almost an entire day of time go down the tubes because of various technical issues. Some of them were mysterious failures of a vendor tool we use, and others we were me trying to use the project that we're working on in ways that it wasn't meant to be used. 

I ran headlong in to the configurations where things just didn't work, and didn't work in a way that I got no feedback that anything was even wrong, just blank screens with placeholder information. 

I'm the new guy on this team. I want to impress them. And I just wasted a day being stymied. I was tired by the end of it and personally frustrated. And on my way out the door, when asked, I whined about it. I even subtly blamed them for my bad day because the error handling wasn't as good as it could be. 

So that same evening, I'm listening to the podcast and here comes Jocko:

"What if I told you 'You're a failure at your job, and you screwed up, and you're a weak leader?' Would you then feel like you really wanted to listen to me? Would you be open to my suggestions at that point? Do you think that I'd be an efficient coach? Do you think I'd even appear as an intelligent human being? If the best I could do to coach you was to tell you that you sucked as a leader, and you're a failure at your job, and you're screwing everything up? And obviously the answer is 'No, no, no, of course not.'"

Ouch. Ouch. Direct hit.

Luckily, he goes on. 

"And honestly, the preferred method of all is covert. The preferred method for me to get Echo to do something different, is for Echo to never even think I had an opinion on it. It's just for me to sneak in there, behind enemy lines, plant the seeds, and let 'em grow. And let Echo come to the conclusion that you're gonna change the way you're doing something. You're going to think differently about something. That's **leadership**. That's real leadership."

Noted.

Of course this isn't new. He talks about this in *Extreme Ownership*. But there were a lot of lessons in that book and it's hard to remember them all. But it's a very timely reminder of that one. 

Probably time to re-read that book, too.
