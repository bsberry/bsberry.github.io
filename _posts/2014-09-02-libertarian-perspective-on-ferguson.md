title:  "A Libertarian Perspective on Ferguson"
---

As self-imposed punishment for totally forgetting last week's blog post, I threw the invitation out to my readers: pick this week's topic. The votes have been tallied, and the most people wanted to hear me write a post on

> Libertarian prospective on Ferguson. When civil liberties and civil rights are both at stake.

Challenge accepted.

I won't try and recite the events that happened in Ferguson. Everything we know about the shooting of Michael Brown is from conflicting eyewitness or secondhand reports. What we do know for sure is that protests and police response in the aftermath of the shooting catalyzed a national discussion on the topic of police and their increasingly regular use of military tactics and weapons.

What separates small-l libertarians (as in, not necessarily associated with the political party) from, say, anarchists is that we concede the necessity of a limited government, composed of police and courts to enforce contracts between consenting adults and a military to defend the nation's sovereignty. The problem is when police go beyond apprehending those that break either the law (aka the social contract) or peer-to-peer contracts and begin bullying citizens for peaceably assembling to vent their frustration (in 1781 they called it "petitioning for a redress of greivances"). 

Make no mistake, the duration and intensity of the protests were caused as much by the police as the protesters. When you assemble to protest the fact that you feel like the majority-white police in your town is bullying the majority-black population and you get bullied by being told to move back, get off the streets, put your hands up, disperse now, and then when you don't you get tear gassed, does that seem like it would raise or lower tensions?

There is a set of rules, informally known as [Peele's Principles of Policing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_Principles#The_Nine_Principles_of_Policing), written in the early 1800s, that define the nature of a successful police force. Almost all of them hinge on the idea that the police can only be effective if they have the co-operation of the public. What Peele left out is that when you lose that, you stop being police and you start being an occupying army. Whether the people of Ferguson lost respect for their police force before or after they donned body armor and acted like a military is a chicken-and-egg problem, but the end result is the same: the sense of division between citizen and state (as enforced by the police) could not have been wider, leading to an us-vs-them mentality on both sides that made neither one want to back down.

As for the actual incident that sparked the protests (and I used the term "spark" deliberately, since any number of things could have set off this powderkeg), we are still astonishingly in the dark about the actual circumstances of what happened. The only comment I will make is that, as someone who studies firearm-based self-defense, the general rule is that skilled and unskilled shooters alike will tend to shoot roughly every quarter second when in a deadly face-to-face encounter. So the autopsy report of Michael Brown being shot six times in the right arm and head is utterly consistent with rapidly pulling the trigger while aiming at a charging assailant and could have all happened in a second and a half.

Whether or not Darren Wilson was justified in shooting Michael Brown may never be known: lacking video evidence, there is only eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence to try and adjudicate complicity. And ours is a legal system that presumes innoncene until guilt, so lacking conclusive evidence, Darren Wilson very well may not even be charged by the grand jury. 

Whether Michael Brown was an innocent civilian shot down for no reason or a violent aggressor justifiably shot in self-defense may never be known. In that scenario, the libertarian response is, perhaps bizarrely, Orwellian: give all cop cars dash cams and all cops body cameras. It has been pithily pointed out that for the same amount of money spent on DoD equipment (APCs, M16s, grenade launchers), the feds could have equipped every policeman in America with a body camera. Of course, body cameras don't get your adrenaline pumping the way door-kicking to serve a misdemeanor drug warrant does.
