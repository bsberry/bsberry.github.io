title:  "Chopping Wood and Carrying Water"
---

On Saturday, I had a pretty good day at the range. 

Daily, repetitive practice, begun in earnest in four months ago and slowly ratcheting up as the practice itself has become a calming, pleasurable center to my day is paying off. 

As I went to put on my gear and get to practicing as though it were some great sacrifice, I thought about the zen proverb:

> Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.

> After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.

I've reflected on this before, thinking about the way that enlightenment, however that manifests in your life, is not something that radically changes your life. It's something that happens in the stream of events and might shift the stream in a better direction, but doesn't drastically alter the flow.

But today, I was reflecting on the fact that I had done these things before I had this great performance, and here I was continuing to do them. I thought to myself that it showed the importance of not ceasing the practice as soon as progress had been made. Continue to carry water and chop wood.

And perhaps there is some truth in that meaning of it, too. But after concluding my practice, I wondered off and my mindfulness dissipated, and I found myself aimlessly killing time. I felt drowsy, so I tried to sleep. I did, fitfully for a bit, before rising to get a glass of water, surrounded as I was by the remains of the annual vandalism of my home in celebration of my birthday. So I spent an hour cleaning. 

And that was when I realized another meaning of the proverb. The nature of the work is important, too. It doesn't say "Before enlightenment, seek enlighenment. After enlightenment, seek enlightenment." Enlightenment may be the goal, but ultimately the pursuit of it should be accompanied by meaningful but menial work. Tasks to occupy the body and give the mind time to, in its own way, seek enlightenment. As I washed endless glasses and scrubbed pans, various and sundry thoughts rose, unbidden and otherwise unobserved, in to my consciousness. 

One of them, of course, being that I really miss blogging.
