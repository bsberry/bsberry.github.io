Despite my open-source, computer revolution roots philosophically, I've struggled for a long time with the idea of Net Neutrality. But I'm finally ready to support it, only now for reasons I hope to make clear.

My very first political leanings began as what I can roughly describe as "change-is-bad conservative", illustrated by an 6th grade wager with Chris Carpenter during gym class. I bet on Al Gore to win the 2000 presidential election, not really understanding the two-party rhetoric and difference between a Democrat and Republican. Gore was the most similar to what we had now, being the current VP, and life was pretty good, so we should keep that gravy train rolling. The protracted recount process meant that my counter-party lost interest and forgot about the bet, so I never had to pay up and buy him a slushie at lunch.

Some time between then and graduating college, I swung to absolute faith on free markets and cooperation, voluntaryism bordering on anarcho-capitalism. If we could just get the government out of everything and let people transact based on mutual benefit, everything would be better. Those are still the ideals I hold, in the sense of an ideal world, but since graduating college and moving in to the world of the real, I've learned that things are never so simple. 

My longtime opposition to any kind of Net Neutrality rules or laws was a staunchly libertarian one, based on the idea that the government telling companies how to act could never create a better outcome than what the market would dictate through success and failure. Carriers should be allowed to implement tiering or throttling and if it proved to be a more successful business model, then so be it. If not, small companies would come up and compete with them and eat their lunch and take over the market. 

To my mind, regulation could never make a market do what it wouldn't willing do via profit seeking. So creating more rules and regulation would just weigh the industry down further and stifle progress. 

What I failed to realize is that those rules only apply to something approximately like a free market, which requires low barriers to entry and exit, allowing for people to try starting competitors and finding out if they can compete. However, this is not the world we live in.

A little over four years ago, AT&T, second of the Big Four American cell phone companies, announced its intention to buy T-Mobile, the smallest of the Four. Citing economies of scale and the cost savings from combining resources, AT&T painted a rosy picture of what bargains they would be able to offer the American public by leapfrogging Verizon to become the nation's largest carrier. 

The Anti-Trust Division of the US Department of Justice was having none of it, and filed a lawsuit to block the merger, on the grounds that (emphasis mine)

> "The substantial increase in concentration that would result from this merger, and the reduction in the number of nationwide providers from four to three, likely will lead to lessened competition due to an ehnanced risk of anticompetitive coordination. Certain aspects of mobile wireless telecommunications services markets, including transparent pricing, **little buyer-side market power, and high barriers to entry and expansion**, make them particularly conducive to coordination. Any anticompetitive coordination at a national level would result in higher nationwide prices (or other nationwide harm) by the remaining national providers, Verizon, Sprint, and the merged entity."

Because, as the DoJ noted earlier in the complaint, carriers set prices across the country and don't discriminate regionally,

> "Such harm would affect consumers all across the nation, including those in rural areas with limited T-Mobile presence."

In other words, not only will competition be diminished, but it *can never be regained*, because the costs of starting up a new mobile carrier would include at the very least, "nationwide spectrum, a national network, scale economies that arise from having tens of millions of customers, and a strong brand".

This developed through the summer and fall of 2011, the year I graduated college and started living in the real world. I knew, intuitively, that this was the right decision, that allowing the market to further concentrate would not benefit consumers, but I couldn't reconcile it with the idea that the federal government of the United States telling a business how to conduct its affairs was a good thing. I wasn't willing to admit that two wrongs, an entry-restricted market and government forbidding companies from doing what companies do, could make a right.

But in the intervening years, we've seen that they *were* right. T-Mobile has rebranded itself as the plucky underdog, developing a reputation for mocking the other carriers in private and public. But more importantly, they've backed it up with policies like offering to pay your early termination fee, the golden handcuffs that keep you locked to your carrier for years at a time--more high barriers, this time to exit, that distort the market. The two-year contract, especially when combined with a family plan that meant contracts never expired simultaneously, was such a lucrative component of the business model of the biggest carriers that the only way it would be challenged is by a small player in the field hungry for market share and willing to innovate and satisfy the customer rather than their own bottom line. In a more perfect market, that would be a new entrant. Since that is functionally impossible in the mobile carrier space, it was T-Mobile the underdog.

This, of course, brings us back to Net Neutrality, and the cognitive dissonance I once held that government coercion could ever lead to a better outcome for regular people. In a free market, with its low barriers to entry and exit, an anti-consumer business model like charging both content providers and the content recievers would be replaced with one where consumers could choose from a wide-open field of competitiors. But that's not the world of cable providers, where [Time Warner Cable and Comcast admit they don't compete because they don't push in on each others' turf](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/06/03/if-comcast-and-time-warner-dont-compete-then-why-shouldnt-they-merge/) and the cost of running copper or fiber optic cable to the curb of every house in a metropolitan area is huge. (TWC and Comcast want to merge, by the way.)

So that's the first wrong. Hopefully, we'll get a second wrong and the FCC will rule in favor of Net Neutrality, but given that [the new Chairman of the FCC Tom Wheeler used to lobby for cable companies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wheeler), I really kinda doubt it.
