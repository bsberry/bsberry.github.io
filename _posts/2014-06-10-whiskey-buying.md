title: "Buying Whiskey As A Gift: A Guide"
---

I recently stumbled on a guide for buying whiskey as a gift, in the context of Fathers Day. This particular guide was full of well-intentioned but useless advice that talked about "fruitiness" and barrel woods that wouldn't be much practical help. But seeing as whiskey is an appropriate gift for celebrating special days all the way down to it being Tuesday, I thought I'd share my much more practical wisdom on the topic.

You don't have to know a lot about whiskey to make a decent run at buying it as a gift, but you do need to know a few things about your recipient. The first is: 

#### Bourbon or scotch?

There are many sub-categories of whiskey, including bourbon, scotch, Irish whiskey, moonshine (unaged corn whiskey), and sour mash. Some people even talk about Canadian "whiskey" which is just a cruel joke; maple flavoring is for pancakes, not a gentleman's spirit. However, we allow them to peddle their "whiskey" here in the States as a historical thank you for their help in supplying "whiskey" during Prohibition, when it was a preferrable option to bathtub gin and radiator hooch which hopefully didn't have much antifreeze in it from the still's previous life on the front of a Model A.

Without going in to overly technical details, scotch and bourbon are defined both regionally (Scotland and Kentucky, respectively) and characteristically. Scotch is traditionally very "smooth" and easy to drink, having a mild flavor. Johnny Walker Red is a blended scotch, a type made by blending the output of many distilleries to gain a desired flavor; it's also usually cheaper. But in order to formulate it to be distinct in a cocktail, Johnny Red ends up being pretty repugnant to drink. If you made a scotch and soda with some Oban on the other hand, not only should you be jailed, but you'd barely taste the subtle, 14 year old flavors when diluted 50/50 with 99c Wal-mart seltzer. 

Bourbon meanwhile has a lot more flavor, being generally rowdier and spicier than most whiskeys. Of course, this distinction is all relative. Give your favorite whiskey sipper a pour of Macallan (a relatively spicy scotch) and Basil Hayden's (an exceptionally smooth bourbon) and challenge them to tell you which is bourbon and which is scotch and watch the hilarity. Allow them one additional pour of each for scientific purposes, and after that rest assured they're trying to just milk you for free whiskey for playing such a cruel prank. 

Many whiskey drinkers like both, but everyone has a preference. If they usually have bottles on hand with rough and ready, American-sounding names like Jim Beam and Bulleit and Wild Turkey, those are bourbons. On the other hand if it's mostly wee Scottish names that start with "Glen" or "Dal" and end in "aig" or "winnie" (someone should make a scotch brand name generator...) then those are scotches. 

In general, stick with what they like in terms of bourbon or scotch. The other question is are they

#### Adventurous or not?

If they like to try new stuff and discover new gems, then you (and your wallet) are pretty much set. If not, stick with the oldies but goodies and get them something they don't always have a bottle of but that's pretty well known. When it comes to bourbon, that's pretty much Maker's Mark, Knob Creek, or any other brand you recognize when you walk down the shelf. For scotch, pretty much Glen-anything that costs $30 or more and sounds like someone you read about in elementary school freeing the Scots from the rule of the British with blue face paint and a broad sword.

On the other hand, for an adventurous drinker, you can buy pretty much anything that says "bourbon" or "scotch" on the label in your price range and they'll enjoy it. Lucky for you, the whiskey drinking community doesn't really allow anything that isn't good for its price point to survive: there's too many other good drinks out there. There is no Bacardi Silver of bourbon. 

#### tl;dr: what should i buy

Okay, that's how it's going to be? Well then:

Bourbon: If you really like them, buy the most expensive Bowman you can afford. If you just kinda like them, get Elijah Craig 12 year. If you want to actively damage their health, buy Old Crow.

Scotch: If you really like them, buy Oban 14y. If you wish they would stop liking your statuses on Facebook but still enjoy spending time with them, go with Lismore. If you simply want them to have a bottle to later improvise a molotov cocktail with, Duggan's Dew.

If you have any other questions, be in touch. My hourly rate is 1.5oz per 15 minutes.
