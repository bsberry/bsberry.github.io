title:  "Heuristic for Evaluating Genuine Endorsements"

I propose a heuristic for determining whether an endorsement of something is genuine: ask the person endorsing it to describe a drawback to it. If they can't, they haven't used it enough to discover any and are just regurgitating marketing hype and/or uninformed naysaying.

Example: I think Pilot G2 pens are the greatest implement of writing ever devised, but the common .07 widths are terrible and spray ink like a firehose. The .038 and .05 widths are much better. And no matter the width, the ink smudges when you use a highlighter on it. I'm willing to deal with that though.

Counter-example: "Teslas are great cars, but they are expensive and you have to charge them every night." (Yeah, but really you probably like that it's a status symbol, and what do you expect from an electric car.) 

If their response makes you go "Yeah, but... really?" and you feel like they're actually trying to make a veiled compliment, they probably are. It's like if you ask someone what their greatest weakness is and they say they work too hard or care too much. Yeah, but... really?

A good drawback should be fairly specific and include justification. They will also very likely sound like they come from a personal experience of some kind. Examples of valid drawbacks:

It's hard to use because... ("X is nice, but it's finicky when it's too humid")
It is fragile because... ("If you set it down too hard you'll knock the Y loose.")
It is expensive because.. ("The coating they use on the Z isn't cheap but the result is totally worth it!")

Bad drawbacks:

"It's kinda fragile." (Too general.)
"Not everyone can figure out to use it." (Demeans the user, says nothing about the device.)
"It's really expensive."

For a lot of people, being expensive is an anti-drawback, because it helps distinguish them from people with less money. 

The best item in a market segment is very rarely the cheapest or the most expensive. It's usually the item that is moderately expensive and often but not always requires a moderate amount of skill to use, depending on the complexity of the task. A good value coffee maker will require more skill (while still being moderately, but not outrageously, expensive) than a good value pen.
