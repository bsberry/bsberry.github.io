title:  "The Three Phases of Changing Someone's Mind"
---

Having had my mind changed about some fairly significant things (diet, shoes, excercise) in the last few years, and seen others go through the same process, I have noticed a few common stages of the phases people go through when you're trying to upend their current beliefs. This is what someone more professional might call a working paper, but I've found the insights here to be helpful enough that you might apply them in your own life.

<h4>Step 1: Obstinate Refusal</h4>
In the first conversation you have with someone about something significant and controversial (like, say, the idea that humans aren't very good at processing grains and would be healthier without them and most added sugars), most people will feel a knee-jerk reaction to defend the status quo. Maybe that parenthetical above even evoked that. For whatever reason, human nature is to sick up for existing knowledge or wisdom and maybe consider the implications of this new information later. The best I've ever done in person is a "That's interesting. I'll have to think about that..."

People will tend to use whatever arguments, whether specious or sound, to bolster their existing point of view and staunchly resist admitting being wrong and change their views on the spot. It may be that you have refuted every argument they've made (although more often than not you'll end up on a tangential digression and never really address the true issue), but the human mind just does not want to willingly concede an argument. At least guys sure as shit don't. But that's okay... The goal of the initial confrontation/discussion is not to convince the person on the spot. It's to plant the seed.

<h4>Step 2: Imagining What Ben Would Say</h4>

This is the part where the magic starts to happen. You and the person you were trying to convince go your own separate ways, and if you're successful, then begin to think about what you said and construct a straw man of you in their own mind. As they go through their day and the topic you discussed comes up, they'll ask this figment of their imagination what you would say. An interlocutor of mine might wake up the next morning and go to eat breakfast of toast and cereal and think "What would Ben eat?" or think about what I would say about that as a grain-and-sugar bonaza. If I've done my job well enough, they will remember enough of our conversation to construct fairly accurate simulacra of my arguments and consider them. 

But I'm not really convincing them anymore. They are convincing themself. There is cognitive dissonance between their long-held view and the one I've professed, and the only way to eventually resolve it is to discount one or the other.

I'm not really convincing them. I'm just giving them the tools to convince themself.

<h4>Step 3: Q&A</h4>

The way you know you've really hooked someone is when they follow up on the discussion and ask you questions. Whether it's a 2am text message or a casual inquiry the next time you see each other, the questions you get asked are the result of being unable to construct an adequate answer to some question based on the previous conversation. *"Okay, I get X and Y, but what about Z?"* At this point you've mostly hooked them, and as long as you can answer those questions reasonably well, they'll probably end up convincing themself you're right over the next few days and weeks.

If it's really important to you, maybe follow up and mention it again. This isn't an absolute process, and sometimes you can go through this cycle a few times, of introducing new information, letting it process, and then answering the follow up questions. But in general, this is how I've found that you change someone's mind.

**Again, you don't convince them they're wrong. You give them the tools to convince themself that there's something more right.**

<h4>A Case Study: This Article</h4>

Right now, you're probably reading this and thinking that it's all well and good, but you've been arguing with and convincing people your whole life and so what does this kid know? That's step 1.

But maybe over the new few weeks, as someone asks you a tough question and you try to convince them, you'll think about this article. Maybe you'll notice bits and pieces of it in your own life, and construct a straw man of me to answer your questions about it. That's step 2.

And, of course, my contact information is in the lower right of this page if you don't know how to get a hold of me already. That's stage 3, and I'm always game to give you the tools to help you find the truth.
