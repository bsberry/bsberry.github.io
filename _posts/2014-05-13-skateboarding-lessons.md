title:  "Three Things I Learned From Teaching Myself To Skateboard"

I have a list of things I'm going to learn to do eventually, like hunting a deer or solving a Rubik's cube, and with my recent transition to a new job in a new city, I decided it was time to tick one off the list: riding a skateboard.

I had long thought of the skateboard as not just a cool youth's toy, but a strong hybrid of practical design. See, my idea went, human legs are really good at one thing: going up hills and stairs. Even pedaling a bike uphill often feels like a waste of energy compared to just walking the bike up. On the other hand, human legs are enormously wasteful when traveling on flat or downhill ground where we have to throw away our momentum with every step. Running helps, but that is a lot more work. So a tool like a skateboard that was man-portable (unlike a bicycle) and light enough to be carried uphill easily but ridden on flats and downhills seemed like a genius design.

So this Spring, now that I was spending a lot of time in Downtown Durham, and walking to a lot of places (mostly bars), I decided getting around on a board would be the perfect thing to do for the impending summer. So I made a half-joking post on Facebook a few weeks before my birthday party demanding someone buy me a skateboard for my birthday (post-scripted with "I am not joking").

#### Lesson 1: Skateboards are Expensive

I'll be honest, I hadn't really given it much thought. In the hours after making that post, I realized that I was asking for a gift that, to be worthwhile, would cost upwards of a Benjamin. Never having been a part of the culture, I had no concept of how much went in to a truly decent skateboard and how precise, for example, the bearings inside the wheels are built or how the trucks attach to the deck to be just loose enough to steer but not loose enough to wobble.

As it happened, I ended up with a board that was much nicer than even a $100 entry-level board. Of course that board came as a bolt out of the blue, indeed as a gift from a friend who mysteriously just had it gathering dust in her closet from someone else.

#### Lesson 2: Skateboards are mostly for flat, wide terrain

My original mental model of a skateboard as being ideal for downslopes of any shape or size could not end up being more wrong for one, obvious in retrospect, reason: no brakes. From the very first time you get rolling on a hill and start enjoying the cruise and then realize you're picking up more and more speed and have no way to dissipate it and find the fear rising in your stomach, you learn that momentum is a cruel mistress. 

Of course, especially on a longboard, there are techniques and equipment to help combat this, like carving back and forth across the hill instead of straight down it to burn momentum turning, or gloves to let you drag your protected palms with makeshift brakepads on them. On the one hand, this means that there is more to the skill of longboarding than just staying on the board or learning to pop fun but ultimately low-utility tricks: the better you get the wider the range of terrain and hills you can tackle.

This has also given me a newfound appreciation for other sports like hang gliding that likewise have no brakes. I'm sure they have their own aerial, gliding version of carving (and don't have to worry about going wide and clipping the curb), but after riding a skateboard down a too-large hill, I think I have a better feeling for what it might be like to know that once you jump off with your hang glider, you're going to end up on the ground one way or another and you just have to hang on. At least on a board you can always bail before you get going *too* fast.

#### Lesson 3: Skateboarding is the ultimate ARG

One of the varieties of Alternate Reality Game that's started appearing on the fringes of mobile gaming involves using your phone's GPS to overlay a game world on top of the real one. In games like Ingress, the game is based around capturing real world locations like statues, monuments, buildings. To take over one, you have to physically travel to that spot, and when you use weapons they only effect objects within a certain radius of your actual location. Games like this take the real world and munge it in to a rule set that makes a game that you then play within. 

Skateboarding is basically the same. Every hill, every curb, every piece of sidewalk becomes an interactive part of your world. On a longboard you optimize your route not by shortest distance but by what has moderate hills, low traffic, and good pavement, yielding a faster trip. On a skateboard, every park bench, curb, concrete parking bump, hand rail, loading dock, and sloped piece of concrete becomes part of an interactive game played not for experience points or gamer score, but for mastery and social acclaim. If you finally nail a lip slide down a 12-stair handrail and no one is around to see it, nobody will believe you.

#### Honorable Mention: Skateboarders love to film themselves

Coming from a sport where I am the outlier in compulsively filming every time I shoot a match, I was surprised but sympathetic when I found that skateboarding culture incorporates religiously making and disseminating trick videos and highlight reels. In every group of skaters, there seems to be one or two guys who handles filming duties. These guys are serious too, with everything from nice prosumer cameras with fisheye lenses to bringing work lights and a generator so they can film any spot, anywhere, any time. Dedication.

Of course, this trickles down, and anyone with a cameraphone and a YouTube account can be a skate filmer. The culture is just rife with people making and sharing home videos, trick tips, and fail collections. A quick search on YouTube reveals [a full page](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=durham+skate+park) of amateur videos from the skate park two blocks from my work. Most of them are boring and amateurish, but then again, my first blog posts a decade ago probably were too. 

Everybody starts somewhere.
