title:  "Fitness, Hunger, and Adaptation"

In late 2012, I began dabbling in reducing my carbohydrate intake to see what this "keto" diet was all about. I slowly started trying to swap out parts of what had become, a year and a half after graduating college, a fairly equilibrium diet. I had never set a New Years Resolution before, seeing them as short-sighted and capricious, but in this case I set the arbitrary date of 1 January 2013 as my cutover. That was the day I would get serious about eating low-carb as an experiment. Since then, I haven't gone back.

In the interim, I've sprinkled in more of the whole foods and paleo approach to diet, and dabbled in a few different types and methods of exercise. I won't pretend that I've found the silver bullet program for everyone, but throughout it all, the ups and the downs, I've found a few things to be generally true, at least for me. 

### Satiety and Fullness
As far as I can tell, most modern American diets are concerned with feeding you a certain *volume* of food, and fullness is the signal to stop, when the raw bulk of the food you've consumed--irrespective of its nutrition--threatens to fill the capacity of your stomach. This is the only explanation I can come up with for certain oddities of the modern diet like a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a (likely sugary) dressing. Aside from the dressing, the rest of the salad is mostly fiber and water and serves only as a temporary placeholder to fill volume in the stomach.

On the other hand, I've found more often I am limited by a sensation I can only label *satiety*. (I haven't done a thorough review of the literature, so I may be using a term of art incorrectly here, but that's okay.) Satiety is a lack of will to continue eating, not for fear of filling the stomach but because your body is telling you that you've eaten enough. As I write this, next to me sits my dinner plate of creamed spinach, scrambled eggs, and pan-fried chicken tenders. It's still half full, not because I was full, but because I was satiated before I could finish it all. 

And if you look at dessert, you'll see the one place that has stalwartly resisted any attempt to go low-fat in the last half-century. I have a pet theory that this is, in part, because the whole point of dessert is to punctuate the meal with a small dose of satiety, even if the rest of the increasingly grainy, mealy, fatless dinner failed to provide it.

The thought experiment I give people is to think of a typical, traditional type of dinner: steak and potato. Let's say you take the potato and replace it with a steak of equivalent volume and task the diner to eat both. Consciously, you might recoil at the idea of That Much Fat, but underneath there's also a undercurrent of your body saying "Oh hell no." The volume is the same as eating only the original steak and the potato, but it can be intuitively reasoned that eating the second steak would be too much. In practice, this effect is very real. 

I actually now generally avoid even the not-unhealthy fillers like non-sugary salads, those devoid of candied nuts and overly-sweet fruit, because I've found my stomach capacity isn't what it once was, and I'll occasionally fill up on those things without being satisfied. 

On the other hand, eating ice cream is now a deeply unsatisfying experience. After consuming it, despite some fattiness to the dessert, I find myself jonesing for more, unfulfilled. That never happens with pork chops. 

### Using Stuff Gives You More Of It
In the modern world, we're used to the idea that if we use up all of our gas, money, or time then at the end we'll be left with none and simply have a bigger gap to fill. But the human body is an amazingly adaptive and responsive organism. Imagine if your laptop battery, the more often you charged and discharged it, gradually adapted more capacity to meet your needs. Imagine if your favorite kitchen knife, the more you used it, the sharper it got. That is essentially the nature of the human body.

This applies in a few obvious places, like muscular strength and endurance, but even these are easy to screw up. I used to think it was dumb to go to the gym (even though I did it out of some misplaced sense of duty) and work a bunch of isolated, specific muscles. When I eventually found a workout cycle of compound, whole-body lifts like squats, bench, and deadlifts, I realized this was what training for the real world looked like. 

As an aside, it also introduced an emphasis on proper technique instead of being guided by a machine, which inherently transfers to any physical task in the real world without the guiding struts of a Smith. Yoga has had a similar effect of cultivating good technique and deliberately using muscles and building flexibility that I'd otherwise be losing day by day. 

But working out has also taught me about another adaptation, which is that expending energy ends up getting you more of it. You might think if you're tired at the end of the day, one of the worst things you could do is to go physically exert yourself for 30 minutes because then you'll just be even more tired. In the short term, and in the absence of a good (I would posit low-carb) diet, this may be true. But if you give your body what it needs and ask for it to perform more, over time it'll do its best to adapt.

The body's ability to adapt to providing higher levels of strength and energy even extend to the more nebulous but no less awesome concept of [what Mr. Money Moustache calls "badassity".](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/09/22/lessons-in-badassity-from-a-night-in-houston/) Everything from being able to tolerate not eating every 6 hours like a sugar addict because you occasionally, willfully go longer without meals to not being as dependent on artificial heating and cooling by letting your body adapt to the weather of the season. (Within certain limits, obviously.) 

You may discount me because I'm young and healthy, but my mentor in all things paleo is old enough to be my dad and regularly eats one meal a day (usually bookended by an anecdote about "imagine our ancestors on the plains being required to feed every four hours"). You may discount him as anecdotal or superhuman or whatever at which point I can't really make the point more clearly. 

I've found this stuff to be true in my experience. I'm always glad to answer questions, and even more glad to be of help.
