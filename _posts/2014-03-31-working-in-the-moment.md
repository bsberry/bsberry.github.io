One of the changes that I've made in my habits since quitting my big corporate job to go work at a small design company (it's been a time of change and reflection on a lot of things, breaking out of a lot of ruts) has been not pushing small tasks that are part of my current work on to an intellectual backlog, presumably to be taken off and dealt with later. Of course, it was very rare that "later" ever came and the task got completed; even physical notes just became a mentally draining, nagging reminder of all the stuff I hadn't tackled.

Key to this change was realizing that the old method just plain didn't work. I would make a "mental note" to "remember to do something" and then promptly move on and forget about it. In the case of some small sub-task at work, like finding some file's documentation lacking or realizing something needed refactoring or testing, I would never take the tim to fix the problem right now. There were always more features to be written and people wondering why it was taking so long.

Heck, even this blog is a manifestation of no longer simply being content to "one day" write up these thoughts that keep coming to me!

#### Why is this so hard to realize?

You would have thought that after a year or two of putting these things on the to-do list and never clearing them off, I would get a sense that this system was clearly broken. The problem is that the system does work sometimes, but not in intellectual, creative tasks. When doing relatively mundane physical tasks like cooking or brewing coffee, there are natural slack times, periods of momentary inactivity that you can use to, for example, clean up the crumbs while the reduction boils. It is simply in the nature of these activities that there will be times of high activity and low. 

However, in something like a job in software design, there really never are slack times. There is always something to be done, perhaps as best modeled by the backlog used in Agile software development. At the start of the release, you list up all the things you're going to try to do before you push out the code, and then you rank them in importance and work down the list, all the way to the most mundane interface tweaks. In this environment, there are always more things to "pull off the backlog" and work on. There will never be a time when you have "nothing to do" and can "catch up" on your "I'll do it later" items.

More importantly, even if there were slack time, you would suffer from postponing the issue. The moment at which you discover it, unless you immediately begin investigating the issue instead of putting it on the backlog, is the moment at which you know the most about it. If you come back to it days or weeks later, your understanding of the problem will be diminished. 

#### How is this not just encouraging ADD?

The hardest part of living more in the now, acting in the moment when you have the most information is to not over-do it. You have to train your brain to say "Okay, this is important, let's tackle this now," without becoming consumed with "Oh, look, something interesting!"

The best way I've found so far to delineate good diversions from harmful distractions is whether or not the tangent is actually related to your current task. Being in the middle of working on one bug and finding another and writing a bug report on it immediately instead of "when I get a chance" is obviously related to the work at hand. Responding to Facebook letting you know that someone commented on your link to some news article isn't. Heck, even just opening a tab to check Twitter (or switching to your eternally-open Twitter client) can trigger that "Let's just do this real quick" center in the brain.

Embracing the now and working in it requires discipline, but in the end, doing it right (like taking the time to write the blog post while it's fresh in my mind, despite having other things to be doing), is mentally satisfying, both by clearing your head of the cobwebs of the backlog and by building the momentum of your day by getting small things done and helping you ramp up to getting big stuff done.
