I was recently re-listening to [Tim Ferriss's interview with Seth Godin](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/). I originally listened to it three or four months ago and found it very interesting. So interesting, in fact, that I knew I hadn't extracted all the marrow from it, so I marked it unread and stuck it all the way at the end of my podcast queue, where new stuff would jump in front of it, for a time when I would have worked through my backlog and be ready for it again.

Well, this past weekend, that time came and went. Listening to that podcast engendered a number of interesting thoughts, as it did the first time, which I've been scribbling down without a good place to put them. Facebook is poorly suited because it's a roll of the dice if a post without an image attached will even be seen, and that medium tends to encourage autonomic response, not thoughtful discussion. (If you want thoughful discussion, feel free to respond to any post here by sending an email to bnbrry at gmail dot com.)

And then, I remembered something else Seth said in that interview. That everyone should have a blog and write to it daily. "Yeah, sure, okay. I've had a blog and writing something every day is a huge undertaking." Except I've been writing these things, whether ideas, or snippets, or quotes, on sticky notes and [virtual sticky notes](https://keep.google.com) for days now, without a place for them. So, here they will go, for as long as they keep flowing.

This blog's previously life was as a long-form, weekly essay. That was gratifying and instructive, especially for the periods where I was writing a week ahead and had time to write a post, forget about it for a week, and come back and edit it and then post it. The times when I've grown the most rapidly as a writer in my life have always been when I've had an editor: Samuel Lemon at Mentor Media in high school and my European Literature professor in my senior year of college who showed me how I should purge "that" from my vocabulary because I always use it to refer to something that's clear to me and opaque to the reader.

These days a good editor is hard to find, especially one that will work on my schedule. Myself in the future is a good one, and he works for leftovers<sup>1</sup</sup>, if occasionally slow to get a response from. We'll see how that model works this time.
