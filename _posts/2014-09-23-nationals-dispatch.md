title:  "Dispatch from Nationals: Day 2"
---

In May 2011, I graduated college on a Friday. A little over a week later, on Monday, I would start my first full time job, taking an offer extended after my successful internship at NetApp. Eager to begin working and begin earning that full time pay check, I almost didn't take any time off, but a well-meaning manager advised me that "Things are different in the real world." Used to having three months' vacation in the summer that I immediately used to start working, I took his advice and took a week off. In hindsight, I think he was right.

Three hours of driving later, I found myself at the entrance to Stone Mountain (the one in NC, not to be confused with [the Mount Rushmore of the Confederacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain)) with a trunk load of borrowed camping equipment and no goal for the next week other than to camp. I wasn't sure what that entailed and I wasn't sure exactly how it was done, but I thought I'd figure it out. Following the signs and ranger's directions to the campground, I found a series of gravel pads intermittently spaced around a loop road of asphalt and pulled up to one. It was Monday and, as I'd later learn, with the weekend far away I basically had the place to myself.

I set about unpacking, and tried to set up the one-person tent that I'd been lent. The dense gravel made it tough, but I eventually perservered, which is to say came face to face with the realization that I didn't have any choice but to figure it out. Tent set up, I drew water from a nearby tap and boiled it to begin making something resembling dinner. Eventually I decided to make a fire in the designated ring and then realized the two bundles of firewood I'd bought didn't take a match flame very well. Devising how to build a fire using the paper towels and cardboard boxes in the trunk of my car ended up being the most rewarding part of the first half of my trip. 

Those first few days were rainy, cold, and boring. Those first two or three days, I rained on and off, and when it wasn't raining, the water from the trees kept a constant drip on my tent, camp site, and good spirits. Before long, the routine of getting up, making breakfast, packing up,  driving to the ranger shack or tent for unanticipated supplies, unpacking, building a fire, making dinner, and then reading until I fell asleep became boringly repetitive. If this was camping, I didn't get it. 

Early that second morning in the camp site, I went to use the bath house that was two minutes' walk from my camp site. I showered, put back on my pajamas, and found myself staring face to face with a listless, despondent mirror reflection of myself. "What do I do now?" I asked myself. My shirt read, "Life is good." I wanted to go home. 

But challenged by my aparrel, I said that this wasn't a chance I should just throw away and run from. If this wasn't what I wanted, I needed to go find it and get it. 

So I investigated the backpack camping sites. After all, the gear I'd borrowed was all designed to be hiked with, including the thin ground pad and sleeping bag that made the car camping site's gravel feel barbed. I didn't need to use the trunk of my vehicle as home base. So I set off from the trailhead that simply informed me that the backpack camp sites were in this direction. I eventually found a series of clearings that were the camp sites, chose the one closest to running water, and began to set up my tent. 

Twenty-four hours before, the only human contact I'd had was seeing from afar the other "campers" with their tents ten feet from their parked cars and wondered if their discontent was as pointed as mine. Here, suddently, solitude was refreshing and invigorating. The rest of the trip was amazing. 

Sleeping on grass (which is easier to drive stakes in and sleep on), gathering my own water, fraternizing and sipping whiskey with the guys at the next primitive camp site over, and eventually cutting my own firewood were a dramatically different experience, one that I could very easily have let slip through my fingers. 

Today, at Nationals, I shot nine amazing, challenging, rewarding stages. I did the same thing yesterday, and I'll do it again tomorrow. In the evening, however, in the intervening hours between dinner and bed, I've found a dearth of activity. Surrounded by fellow match staff who range from fifteen years my senior to well older than my parents, I've found my working vacation lacking in amity. 

I feel as though I'm at that crossroads again. I've come a long way and find myself in unique circumstances. The truly rewarding part of this trip is out there, and I just have to go find it. I just have to challenge myself.
