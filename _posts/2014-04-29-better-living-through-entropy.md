In cryptography, everything is based around random numbers. But since computers can only take in data and process it deterministically (same input, same output), the best you can get for encrypting your email or messages or phone calls is psuedo-random numbers, numbers that are "pretty" random, but not quite truly random. The best psuedo-random numbers are the ones that are the most *like* a truly random number and the most unpredictable. To get a truly good psuedo-random number, you need a decent algorithm (psuedo-random number generator) and a lot of entropy.

Entropy is a term borrowed from physics, where it talks about the disorder and chaos in a given thermodynamic system. Cryptographers appropriated it to refer to gathering chaotic, truly random data from the environment and using it as the inputs to a PRNG. Modern crypto software like TrueCrypt might ask you to erratically move your mouse around in a window and use that as entropy because it's utterly unpredictable. For a while, one of the best sources of psuedo-random data used the random and unpredictable movements of lava in lava lamps to generate numbers.

What does this have to do with you and your life? As chaotic as it may seem already, you would probably benefit from having an injection of entropy.

#### Like a lava lamp for your life

The biggest source of entropy in my life recently (that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but isn't) has actually been my roommate. Having a second person inhabiting your living space, especially a new one with different habits does a lot to make you re-examine what you've been doing and the compromises you might have made to get along.

For example, for at least a year, the automatic ice maker hasn't produced ice in my fridge. I can coax it to eject one batch at a time, but it's really pretty inconvenient and doesn't scale at all. Maybe it's cheap to fix; I haven't really looked. But I've been content with my broke-down ice maker because it's mine, dammit, and this is what fiscally responsible adulthood is like. My roommate finally said *screw that* and just bought some ice cube trays, which now get heavy use. I would never in a million years have let myself buy ice cube trays like some kind of poor college student because *that's not who I am*, but the benefit of having someone else inject some entropy in to your life is that it doesn't give a shit about your self-image.

An even bigger example from just yesterday is that my roommate had his girlfriend over and they were watching TV on the second floor of the house. So I could either waste time on my computer up on the third story or go down to the first floor and reload ammo for this weekend's match. I chose the latter, and as I was down there, I realized I should also dry fire for the weekend's match, which I usually do in the living room. Before you knew it, I had targets cut out on the wall of the garage, and I'm thinking that this might be a good place to play around with making a series of [videos about dry fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj9tjZTZt3A) that I'd had bouncing around my head for a while. So I grab my camera and my tripod, sure enough, I'm tackling a project that I'd been meaning to get around to any day now.

No roommate, no roommate's girlfriend, no exile to the basement, no video. I'm happy with how things turned out.

#### Don't go smashing windows

Of course, this isn't to say, like the proponents of the Broken Window Fallacy in the 1800s, that all destruction and disorder improves your life. Nor that everyone should go out and get someone to live in your spare bedroom (although the cash helps with getting out of debt). Like everything in life, moderation is key.

My encouragement to you would be to simply live your life in a way that is open to having a little entropy injected now and then. Hang out with friends even if you're not sure if you'll have a good time. Say hi to the stranger you might recognize from college just in case. Don't assume that your daily routine has cracked the happiness code and that you should just keep recycling it every day until you forget your name and start drooling on yourself.

Or, you know, just assure yourself that doing new stuff is lame, most people are jerks, and you don't have the time or money to fit anything else in to your life already anyway.

Your choice, I guess.
