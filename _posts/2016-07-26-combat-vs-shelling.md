Three different podcasts I listen to have all touched on the topic of the psychological effect of shelling and artillery recently. Jocko Podcast episode 10 talked about it, Tim Ferriss interviewing Sebastian Junger talked about it, and Dan Carlin's WWI series talked about it.

Combat is direct. You know when it starts, you know when it ends. At any moment there is something you can do to actively resist. Combat can be filled with gruesome, horrible things and still be comparatively undamaging because everything bad comes from an enemy has a relatively known location, with whom you can close and engage. 

Being shelled in the other hand is incredibly psychologically damaging. You live for days or weeks on end, never knowing when the lightning bolt will fall out of the sky and kill or maim you or your squad. It's random. It's indirect. Usually you don't know where the shelling is coming from, or if you do it's from far enough away that you can't just move that direction and stop the threat.

And this, I think, helps me understand a divide I see between the way my gun-owning (and largely concealed-carrying) friends see the world and the way everyone else does.

Concealed carriers see mass shootings as combat, something to train and equip for and hope never happens, but if it does, they will face it. 

Regular folks see mass shootings as shelling. Random, unstoppable, gruesome. They never know where the lightning bolt will come from and feel totally helpless to stop it.

And that's why nobody can see eye to eye on it.
