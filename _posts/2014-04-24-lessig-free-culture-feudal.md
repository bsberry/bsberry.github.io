> A free culture is not a culture without property; it is not a culture in which artists don't get paid. A culture without property, . . . is anarchy, not freedom. . . . But just as a free market is perverted if its property becomes feudal, so too can a free culture be queered by extremism in the property rights that define it.

<p style="text-align:right">&mdash; Lawrence Lessig in <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">Free Culture</a></p>

I learned from my father about how copyright laws are being extended faster than time passes, and if current trends continue, nothing since *Steamboat Willie* will ever default to the public domain. 

But this is a fascinating way to look at things. As time goes on, by default, more and more of the creative output of our society belongs to the studios and publishers, and their dominion grows. Feudal lords were "free" to trade with each other, but that didn't mean that the serfs had anything you could call "freedom."

Although in the end, the lords were unable to control the peasants, and looking at Game of Thrones being the most pirated TV show in history, I do wonder how the studios will be able to do in the future trying to control us little guys, when copying their output is so easy.
