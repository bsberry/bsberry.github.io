When I first read *Rocket Boys*, it was an extra credit assignment in math class. I was never an especially hard worker in school, being able to largely skate by with mostly completing homework assignments and retaining the whats, whens, and whys from lectures. But when there was extra credit, I would jump on it when it was something I was good at, to have that extra cushion to my grades so my parents wouldn't bother me about playing Counter-Strike all the time. So extra credit for stuff like building a diorama or whatever wouldn't catch my attention, but reading a book about science and math and then answering questions about it was basically like getting credit for breathing air.

 At any rate, my 8th grade geometry teacher's ploy to get us reading about applied math worked flawlessly, at least on me. By the time I finished the dogeared paperback copy I borrowed from her, I knew I liked it, in a way that I never had with Asimov or Tolkien or Brust. (A year or two later I'd ask for a hardcover copy that I've since read at least half a dozen times.)

See, *Rocket Boys* is the story of a rag-tag group of high school kids in a company coal town in the middle of nowhere West Virginia who get inspired by Sputnik and Werner von Braun to build and launch their own rockets. Growing up where they did, nothing more was expected of them than to finish high school and then go work in the mine. But they decided, without being asked or told by anyone else, to set out on this quest to launch some rockets. 

Reading the book for the first time as an 8th grader, I was impressed by its message of opportunity and ambition, that if these kids not much older than me in a much less advantageous situation could set their minds to something and do it, then I probably could too. When I read it again in 9th grade, it left a similar impression, except now I'd had a taste of the wide open possibilities of high school with its electives and clubs and advanced classes.

That pretty much carried on throughout my time at Southeast Raleigh High, reading the book every year or so and each time find it freshly invigorating. The way that Sonny and the Rocket Boys knew they had to get out of Coalwood and go to college, with these missiles as their ticket was actually a revelation to me at a time in my life when I didn't really have a plan or a destination. If you asked me in 11th grade what I wanted to be, I might have said that I wanted to make video games. In 12th grade, after I picked up a side job writing articles about *World of Warcraft*, I might have told you I wanted to be a writer. But the truth is, when it came time for me to go off to college,--my going was never in doubt--I picked the major that aligned with the only class I'd gotten 4 semesters of As in: Computer Science. 

The kind of single-minded purpose that Sonny took with him was unfamiliar but inspiring to me.

Sonny and the high school version of me were also alike in more ways than I had any concept at the time. Being written in young Sonny's voice, the whole book put everything in terms I'd use myself. But being actually scribed by an older and wiser, grown-up Sonny (his actual name is Homer), there lies another layer to the book of wryly chuckling at his own pubescent foibles.

I even recall being a total know-it-all when it came time for the test. To prove that I'd actually read the book, I had to stay after class and withstand a verbal examination from my teacher on the text. At one point, I was asked about a particular dramatic scene in the book involving a blizzard that snowed out the high school and what Sonny's reaction to it was. Not remembering that part of the book, and being too clever by half, I jumped to the assumption that this was a trick question. 


>"I don't remember that being in the book..." I said slyly, sure the game was afoot.

>"Just tell me what you remember about the storm."

>"Are you sure that was in the book?" I said, trying to lure my unsuspecting instructor in to my carefully laid trap.

>"More sure than you are, Mr. Berry. Let's move on to talk about the Science Fair..."

I can't put my finger on what exactly has so ensared me about the book and its sequels telling more stories from Coalwood, WV, but they have. To me, just like to grown up Homer, Coalwood is a place, a real place with a beating heart that belched black coal dust and a circulatory system of hardworking miners and gossiping wives. A flawed place, lending it charm and character, and an ephemeral place, unrecognizable today. 

But perhaps most importantly, a real place. A regular place. Not--before *Rocket Boys*--a famous place, and even since then never a hopping metropolis or destination. Just an ordinary home town where extraordinary things happened. 

And that is what makes the books so touching. If this kind of story hid for so long in the hollows of McDowell County, what other tales of strength and honesty and honor are hiding all around us in the corners of our own lives? The genius, ultimately, of *Rocket Boys* was not the antics of those high schoolers, but in recognizing and celebrating them so that we all might be a little more inspired.
