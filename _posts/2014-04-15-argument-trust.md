Think back to the last time somebody convinced you of something. Actually sat down, hashed out the issues, and changed your viewpoint. Odds are it wasn't in a single sitting (the topic for another post), but in the end, the person who ended up changing your mind had to prove themself to you before you'd believe them. Every time somebody tries to persuade you of something, whether youre're conscious of it or not, you are evaluating their credibility. Whether or not you end up buying in to what they're selling depends on whether you're satisfied they are qualified on the topic.

<h4>Anonymous, electronic slapfights</h4>

This is a key insight in to what may be one of the most mystifying emergent social orders of our modern age: arguing on the internet. Take for example an internet forum, where the pattern is familiar: people shouting past each other, not merely convinced of their own argument, but essentially uninterested in actually listening to opposing ideas or having their own views changed. After all, these people are random strangers on the internet. Without any credibility or identity to assign to these ethereal debaters, you have no reason to consider their argument. 

It's no wonder that so few minds are changed. 

Or consider the comments on a blog. The regular readers there were attracted by the authority, identity, and credibility of the blogger, but when confronted in the comments by faceless, nameless people disagreeing, there is no reason to take their argument seriously. You don't *know them*.

<h4>The Social (Disfunction) Network</h4>

As a final example, allow me to present: the Facebook comments argument. Given the nature of Facebook, no two people see exactly the same thing, with each person being fed a filtered, computationally curated list of content from some subset of the people they have designated as "friends." When you jump in to comment on a post of a friend's, that comment is then shown to that person's various and sundry social circles, with which you have absolutely zero knowledge or reputation. Virtually by definition, you are arguing (assuming it's a controversial post) with people who, despite having name and a profile picture, are still essentially nameless and faceless. Why should you listen to them when you have no reason to think they know what they're talking about?

<h4>Let it never be said I don't offer solutions</h4>

All moaning about the anonymity of the internet aside, this has very real, very practical applications to your life and the practice of effectively convincing those around you of your viewpoints. 

My rule is to avoid appealing to an authority that you trust but that your audience has no reason to place stock in. After getting a handle on my life financially and getting out of debt on the advice of Dave Ramsey, I started trying to tell others about it. I thought I was being intellectually honest when I attributed steps and wisdom to Dave, but I was only trying to convince them to trust someone who they had no reason to trust. 

Instead, now I just say *I did such and such* and *ended up having such and such result* and let people decide on their own whether I'm a trustworthy source for this. Asking them to trust a source they have reason to trust, me, rather than a stranger they don't know, will always result in a more convincing argument.

Hint: if you ever ask "Have you heard of ..." in a conversation and they say no, that's not a good source to appeal to.

Just like in effective communication of any sort, don't be limited by your own thoughts, experience, and knowledge. Put yourself in the shoes of your listener and think about who they would find convincing. It's probably not the same people you would.
