  --Zen Proverb*

Some years ago, a friend of mine introduced me to the concept of goal-oriented people and outcome-oriented people. As she described the dichotomy, I knew that I was inescapably a process-oriented person.

It took a few years of being a software developer managed by goal-oriented people to confront the cognitive dissonance I faced when a project I worked on was cancelled or mothballed. Everyone around me was frustrated and dejected because they didn't cross the finish line. Inside, though, I was just glad to have gotten to work on it and learn in so doing. Whether it shipped or not, my time working on it was done and there was a new challenge to attack. Why were we frustrated and unhappy?

This is a blessing and a curse. Contentment comes fairly easily for me because I can find satisfying process in almost anything. I can shrug off most bad experiences and write it off as a learning experience. I will occasionally do something, like eating a food I think I don't like or watching a show I think I don't like or engage in a behavior I'm pretty sure is a waste of time, just to confirm. And when I do, I feel satisfied.

No effort was wasted if something was learned.

The downside to this is that occasionally I neglect to reach my destination because I'm too absorbed in the texture and shape of the path in front of me. 23 months ago, I started developing an Android app to help myself practice for shooting competitions more effectively. When I started, I told myself that this would be my first break as an independent developer: an app that was all mine. I thought I was motivated by the goal of shipping software and helping fellow shooters.

However, three moths later I had an unpolished, buggy, but usable app that let me do what I wanted to in practice. After that, development largely ceased. Making something did not motivate me. Improving the process of my practice motivated me and as soon as that barrier was overcome, my animus evaporated. To this day, it's a running joke among shooting friends, the Chinese Democracy of apps.

But, privately, I know that instead of making the app ready for production, I've gotten back to practicing. And I'm seeing results from that.

I woud love to be of service to others, and like to think the weekly podcast I do helps thousands. But I'm realisitic now that I will only persist in an endeavor if the process itself is compelling and interesting to me.
