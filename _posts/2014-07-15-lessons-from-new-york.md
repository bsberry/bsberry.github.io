title:  "Lessons Learned from New York City"
---

This past weekend, I flew up to New York City for a couple of days. In truth, I felt borderline contractually obligated to complete the trip. I had dear friends offering me a spot on their couch, and if I was ever going to get a chance to bum around the city with a few pseudo-locals it was now or never. And besides, *my absence had been noted*.

Of course, I should hate New York City. Gun rights are basically non-existant there, taxes are ridiculous, everything is expensive, and the government is generally vexatious and meddlesome (the brainchild of anti-gun crusader Michael Bloomberg). The rational economic thing to do for pretty much anyone living in New York City would be to move somewhere with lower taxes, more land, lower prices, and less government (like Raleigh) and benefit from the lower cost of living. But what that analysis lacks is the fact that New York City actually has a *quality* to it that I've never quite encountered anywhere else, and it's really quite extraordinary. 

For example: everyone knows the city is crowded. It has almost as many people as the entire state of North Carolina, and only misses even that mark because of NC's rapid growth in the last decade. But this raw human density has fostered an atmosphere of callous indifference. When you pass a hundred people a minute on the sidewalk, you fundamentally don't have time to nod to or smile at each one. 

Everybody understands that everyone else has places **to be**. When you pass someone on the sidewalk the same way you would in a car on the highway, it's not personal and it's not rude. It's just the pace of life. As it turns out, I find this pleasantly efficient and enjoyable. In contrast to the slow pace of Southern living (which I am by no means ready to trade in), there's no presumption of mannerly respect; instead what you have is a respect for the other guy's time and assume he has the same for you when you quickly step across his path. It's a tacit acknowledgement that you both have got other places to get to, in a hurry. Ironically, what it most reminded me of was the quick, efficient movements I use all the time in pistol competitions. 

I assume this must be a component of the reputation that New York has for everyone being rude. And I guess to the uninitiated it could seem that way. I certainly wasn't unduly verbally accosted by any ornery New Yorkers--I get more of that from my NJ and NYC émigré shooting buddies--and it wasn't like I stuck to the touristy parts of town, either. As I somewhat unexpectedly hiked across Hell's Kitchen and Midtown, full of cooks and delivery boys and businessmen, never once did I have anyone act in any way rude. 

In fact, the one rebuke I got the entire trip was as I sat on a slight concrete step outside the stage door of a theatre at 1pm, eating a hot dog from the ubiquitous sidewalk vendors. Figuring it to be the middle of the day and the door not getting much use, I sat a spell to eat, but halfway through my dog a stocky, techy-looking guy materialized out of the stream of passersby to enter, and pointedly told me, "Hey buddy, this is a door." Was that rude? I guess. At the time, it struck me as the most efficient way to communicate his meaning and get on with his day. 

Another thing that struck me about New York City, or at least Manhattan, was Central Park. Instead of being like the small provincial parks that dot Wake County, Central Park is like someone took a centrifuge to the entire island of Manhattan and all of the nature collected in the middle and all the city at the edges. It's big in a way that's hard to describe. 

Perhaps the most interesting thing about it is that it's long and thin, meaning you're never too far from part of it, and it's just wide enough that thirty seconds or a minute after you walk in, you are surrounded by trees and the skyline feels a little more distant. I get the feeling that it really is a necessary part of life in Manhattan, the otherwise ultra-dense maze of high-rise canyons. Whether you jog through it every morning or just catch a view of the trees, I have the weirdest sense that it fills an innate human need to go out and be in nature every now and then to stop from going stir-crazy.

And if everyone in the city needs some small slice of nature now and then, rather than everyone inefficiently owning a half acre of backyard that they use perhaps 30 minutes a day, the entire city has 843 acres to share, whenever they need it. If you approach the problem of trying to supply the most nature to the most amount of people, it turns out to be a rather elegant solution.

I went to New York City expecting it to be a noisy, cramped, expensive police state* and was surprised to find a culture well-adapted to letting millions of people efficiently go about their business in a way that was shockingly full of life. It's not clear if I'll get to go back again soon, but I'd rather like to.

\*I *did* see more license plate scanners in my three days there than in the entire sum total of my life to that point, though.
