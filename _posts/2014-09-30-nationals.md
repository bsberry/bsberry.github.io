We're sitting across a fraying-at-the-edges fiberboard table in a run down Mexican restaurant. I stumble over the Spanish dish names. I'm worried because I don't have very much cash and they don't take cards. She's telling me about her upcoming trip to Qatar for two months for work. We have a brief diversionary conversation about how I don't understand the altrusitic, humanitarian motivation to her work. Making a difference in peoples' lives instead of writing apps to help people spend their money more efficiently has a certain appeal, though, I concede.

The conversation comes back around to my paralyzed decision-making. I've done the math, and I could fly to Las Vegas, rent a car, spend a week in the desert shooting and then working the USPSA National Championship, the most presitigious event in my chosen sport of practical shooting. Their compensation package would cover it all.

The upsides are unknowable. I'll get to shoot nationals, which is an accomplishment? I might have fun and make some friends? Travel to a new place? The downsides could be significant. Cost overruns. Wasted vacation time. Sunburn or other discomfort during a week in the desert. 

I've been chewing it over for three weeks and the math is coming up roses, but for some reason I just can't bring myself to do it. To sign up. To commit. It's like I need a nudge. An encouraging nod. Permision to take a chance.

My soon to be temporarily-Qatari dinner mate gives it to me.

As it turned out, I got the up- and the downsides. There were times I was bored and wished my phone wasn't dead. But there were other times when there was no other place I'd rather be and no other place in the world I could be doing what I was doing and learning what I was learning. There were unexpected costs, mostly my own fault. But every single one ended up being worth it. 

Sitting on the airplane back, I tried to figure out how to describe the experience to people. Saying that we shot the 28-stage match in three days and then ran 12 squads of 8-10 people through the stage each day for four days, starting shortly after dawn and going until dinner time doesn't do it justice. There were the brief respites between running squads when the other two ROs on the bay and I joked about the weather, holsters, rules clarifications, and ornery shooters. There was the focused intensity of being a shooter between stages, ardently working to remain hydrated, cool, and energetic. 

In one sense, it had the feel of a fan convention, like GenCon or World Con or Animazement: this annual gathering and celebration of a shared culture. Your chance to catch up with old friends you see once a year and make new ones with a guaranteed common interest. You got to meet some of your heroes and celebrities, even if only on the internet, and watch them do their thing. 

In another sense, it felt a bit like summer camp. For a week, in a far off corner of Nowhere, Utah, we all got together to challenge ourselves, share hardship, get up early and stay up late, and go to sleep every night physically spent and eager for the next day. Courses of fire, stripped of their props, shade tents, chairs, and supplies had the freshly-lifeless feel of a bunkhouse with all the beds stripped of their sheets, ready for the next batch of residents. 

If I could have sidled in next to myself at that taco shop booth and given myself a few pieces of advice, I'd have said: buy your plane tickets today. Ship your ammo well, well in advance so you don't have to check 300 rounds on the flight out and come back with 400. And nobody told you this, but you're signing up to shoot the match at a fairly leisurely pace and then get four days of private instruction in how to be a better range officer. Be ready to put on the white belt and learn from everything. You won't regret it.
