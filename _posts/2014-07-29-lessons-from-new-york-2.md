title:  "Lessons From New York, Part 2"
---

Walking across town, traversing from Hell's Kitchen to Midtown and the theater district, fruitlessly searching for coffee on the second day of my trip to New York City, I noticed a growing change in the character of the people around me. Just as I began to put my finger on it, I had my worst fears confirmed. I had wondered in to *tourists* and inadvertently stumbled right in to Times Square. 

*"Hmmm. Smaller than it looks on TV,"* I thought to myself.

 This would prove to be the defining theme of that afternoon roaming around lower Manhattan. I eventually made my way to Wall Street, which surprised me by being only six short blocks long, as well as a complete tourist fest and accordingly pretty lame. The best thing I saw there was the impeccably dressed doorman for Tiffany & Co. with his tailored suit, tiffany blue pocket square and tie, and hat. I was actually taken aback when I realized he was wearing a bowler because it's such a weird thing to see outside of a movie these days, but he made it work. Impressive.

At the bottom of Wall Street, I had some time to kill and walked toward the Staten Island Ferry, a free 25 minute trip to the least interesting of the boroughs which along with way provides, I'm told, a good view of the Statue of Liberty. After a quick round of "Spot the Concealed Carrier" (he was definitely carrying, but when he played with Port Authority agent's dog, I figured he was just plainclothes NYPD), I made it in to the terminal to wait for the next ferry.

I was only able to stand around for about 30 seconds before deciding that this particular crowd of agape gazers were the last cohort I wanted to spend the next fifty minutes of my life trapped on a boat with. So I hopped the subway back up town, a 30 minute trip from the southern tip of Manhattan to 66th street, hopefully before rush hour set in. Having sat in traffic on 40, I didn't really have any interest in getting stuck *and* squished for a long trip.

I grabbed a seat in the subway car that was entirely empty except for my fellow boarders, and in the waning hours of my second day abroad in the city, felt comfortable enough to put in my headphones and just let my mind wander for a bit while the subway worked its way up to Columbus Circle. I thought about how even the subway, hurtling along dark, underground passages and enormously faster than foot travel for any distance, still wasn't *quick*. My long ride home would only be, as the crow flies, a little over 5 miles, meaning I would be averaging the speed of a bicycle at a good clip on a back road. 

It required a recalibration of my entire sense of scale and the relationship between distances and time. My 20 mile, 20 minute commute back home has no place here where waiting for a subway, taking it one stop, and then walking half a mile to work could eat up a 20 minute commute despite being not much further on a map than I travel to get out of my subdivision. 

Looking around the subway car, I noticed the other passengers were mostly residents, and even the tourists were less obvious, like the otherwise inconspicuously-dressed family of three with the father obviously herding his wife and teenage daughter. At least they weren't wearing sneakers with jeans. Dead giveaway.

My mind wondered and I reflected on the enormous number of international travelers to New York City. It struck me as odd that they might come to the US and take as a representative sample one of the most singular and peculiar places in the country. It made me wonder what they came to New York to see. Of course, in truth the main exhibit for me was visiting friends, with the rest of my time spent giving custom to whatever musuems struck my fancy. I wouldn't have flown to the New York to see "Starry Night," but as long as I was passing through, I might as well. I definitely wouldn't fly beyond seas for it.

I shook my head and realized I'd been dozing, and the numbers on the wall of the station were telling me it was almost time to walk again. I was tired from already having pounded miles of pavement, but luckily my lodgings were close to the stop. My hosts and I had drinks reservations in a few hours and a concrete plan to wing something for dinner. It was going to be a good evening.
