As a rule, I do not deface or disfigure books. 

It was impressed upon me early that books are to be treated with care and respect. This is in part from my librarian mother, and in part my stern father, who I can clearly recall patiently telling me, at six years old, that pages are only to be turned using the corners, not pinched in the middle until they can be flung across. God only knows why he ever let me touch his tomes.

Throughout college, where my cohort highlighted their textbooks, I simply transcribed key passages and annotated them. I recall when I bought my copy of Dante's *Inferno* used and found it quite quaint and eccentric which passages its previous owner had found insightful enough to highlight. Even there, where the book had already been despoiled, the thought of marking it up further never crossed my mind.

However, recently, re-reading *Rocket Boys*, the idea was sown in my mind. *Rocket Boys* is, and has been since I first read it in the Eighth Grade, my favorite book. It's a tale of discovery, a tale of growing up, and most of all a tale of legacy: doing things that will last long beyond the moment in which they are done. One of the most touching parts of the story involves the author going through a book of poetry belonging to his father and finding a particular poem circled. That kind of temporal message, sharing with your progeny that which meant most to you, is a deep and powerful concept. 

As I recently again picked up my copy of *Mastery* by George Leonard, another book I am eternally in the process of reading, in the spirit of learning and experimenting (one of the keys to mastery), I decided to mark especially profound sections of the text. Perhaps for any friend I might lend the book to, or an unconcieved but concievable child of mine, I thought I would begin to lay down a legacy in the pages of this book.

At first I was unseasy. Each indelible pen mark on the page made me wonder a little bit more what I was doing.

Eventually, I realized the error of my ways. The entire genius of *Mastery*, not to mention *Rocket Boys*, is that each time you read it, you are a different person. Each time you read it, something different strikes you as profound. If you successfully learned a lesson from the last reading, that passage will now seem rudimentary and obvious to you, and seeing it underlined will only make you wonder how you ever didn't know it in the first place. As with many of the behaviors of my fellow college students, marking up a book as you read it turns out to be an exceedingly short-sighted activity.

Of course, I now realize as well that what I had missed in *Rocket Boys* is that, the reason that Sonny, the narrator, has to read a circled poem to learn about his father is that his father was an exceedingly stolid and stoic person who could only be connected with through the side-channel of a book. Of the many blessings I've had in my life, an open and effusive father is one of them. I don't need pen marks to tell me which books are his favorite, because he's told me about them. He read them to me as a child. He's got them all on his shelves. 

If I do half as well, I don't have anything to worry about when it comes to my legacy.

Except making a bunch of stupid marks in this book I treasure, I guess.
