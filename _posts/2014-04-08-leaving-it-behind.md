In the spring of 2010, I was in my third year of college, taking a lot of fairly meaty Computer Science courses, like Data Structures and Human-Computer Interaction, while at the same time upending my "professional" life. I had been quite content to coast along in my development internship at SAS, working part time during the week and full time during the summers. 

So when a friend from school convinced me that I could work at his company for the summer and make the same money I made all year at SAS, and maybe work the rest of the year as a bonus, I was interested. Very interested. Looking back, it seems like a no-brainer decision, but I also recall all the trepidation I went through over leaving my SAS team that had taught me so much. Of course, the change ended up being a huge moment of growth for me, as I gained perspective on how not just one team and one company runs, but how a completely different team at a different company runs.

So, in May of 2010, I started work as an intern at NetApp. One of the most significant changes, at the time, was that SAS had interns, and NetApp had an Intern Program. There was an entire class of interns that summer, all of whom I got to socialize with at various events and outings designed to give us a shared sense of community and identity. 

And there is no thing more singularly effective thing you can do to foster belonging to a group than to get them to wear the sigil of the group. So when they gave us hoodies with a blue NetApp logo on the breast and the inscription "2010 Summer Intern" on the sleeve, I wore it. It took a few months for it to get cold enough to justify it, but I wore the hell out of it. Not literally, of course. I treated it with care, since it was an utterly irreplaceable part of my self identity. 

Since I left NetApp, that hoodie hangs in my closet. Every time I see it, it reminds me of those younger days, when I knew less and was happier that way and couldn't imagine anything better.

More importantly, though, it reminds me that at any given point in life, there is a set of objects that you can't imagine not having around. Things that are such an integral part of your daily life or identity that losing them would forever alter you. 

But since we as humans are always in a state of change and improvement, it's very likely a time will come when your values or personality will change and when the time comes to leave it behind, what was inconcievable becomes sensible and logical. Leaving NetApp was a scary leap of faith in my life, but by the time it happened, it was also inevitable. 

This is just an example, but the underlying concept has become enormously comforting to me. There will come a time when I stop shooting competitively, or riding a motorcycle, or writing software, and the odds are that when it happens, it's simply because I will have changed as a person and grown beyond it. I used to spend a lot of time worrying about what I would do if I had to give up something I loved, but the fact of the matter is that having to do that is comparatively rare. More often, time slowly tugs it away from us until we hardly miss it at all.
