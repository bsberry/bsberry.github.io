On [Jocko Podcast episode #13, around the 1h37m mark](https://youtu.be/Xqy3Sh7BlaY?t=5827), Jocko, who was in the SEAL teams for more than a decade, fields a question about why he doesn't tell more stories about BUD/S. 

Basic Underwater Demotion / SEAL training is broken up in to three phases, where phase 2 and 3 teach you to be a SEAL, but phase 1 is more of a test and less training. It's very grueling and is there to weed out people who don't have what it takes to be a SEAL. Part of that is standing up to the physical tests and being victorious in the challenges where you're split up in to teams. But an equal challenge is the ability to subsume your ego, work as a team, and cooperate to victory. Gloryhounds will be destroyed. 

That said, all of that is just the selection process. It's flashy, it's interesting, it's sticky. It tests whether you have the ability to even fit in. 

But, Jocko says, that's not what's interesting. It's a requirement to be a SEAL, but it isn't what being a SEAL is. It's just a test, and if you pass the test, then you get to go and do ever harder stuff for as long as you can handle it.

And it reminded me of Ben Stoeger talking on the Triangle Tactical Podcast when we interviewed him last year. Where most people in this sport view being an IDPA Master or USPSA GrandMaster as a great achievement, Stoeger talks about it as being a fairly straightforward challenge. There are relatively few skills tested by either classifier system, both are fairly easy to practice for, and there are even publicly-available, objective standards for them. Nobody can tell you what time on El Prez will win you Nationals, but it's fairly easy to figure out what El Prez time you need to make GM.

Now, obviously I'm not saying being a GM is as hard or even comparable to being a SEAL. But for everyone in USPSA who dreams and idly talks about getting a g-card, I'm guessing it's the same in the Navy about guys in their endless time with nothing to do, talking about giving BUD/S a shot. 

But if BUD/S is the goal, the thing after it not actually be what you want. In the same way, people either work or scheme their way to a 95% classifier average, but that's because all they want is the G-card. They don't want to BE a GM. They don't want to be challenged and have to shoot against the best with no excuses.

And that was a gut check for me. Because I do want that. I do want to get destroyed and get humbled and get motivated to keep getting better. Yeah I've set the goal to make GM this year by getting that 95% classifier average, but it's just a stepping stone. It's just a box to check off. It's just a pre-req to do the next thing. 

And the way Jocko talks about it, BUD/S is the same way.
